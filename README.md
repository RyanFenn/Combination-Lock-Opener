# Combination-Lock-Opener
A repository to store code and other files associated with the Combination Lock Opener project. 

**Repository notes:**
- This program was developed using the PlatformIO IDE
- This code runs on a custom development board with an ATmega2560
- Changing the default_envs variable within the platformio.ini file from CustomBoard to ArduinoMega will allow the program to be uploaded to an Arduino Mega, but this is only useful when testing certain features such as the touchscreen
- The platformio.ini file lists external libraries used
